        The Giant Panda, one of the most delightful and captivating of animals,
        is also one of the most endangered. The best scientific estimates
        indicate that there are less than 2,200 Giant Pandas remaining in the
        world today. In 1999, after a trip to China and the Wolong Panda Center,
        the plight of the Giant Panda made such a dramatic impression on Suzanne
        Braden and Diane Rees that upon returning to the United States, they
        co-founded Pandas International,<br/>
        A registered 501(c)(3) non-profit, to
        help save this magnificent animal. Unlike other organizations which
        serve many animals, Pandas International is exclusively devoted to the
        Giant Panda. As the Director of Pandas International, Mrs. Braden (left)
        coordinates both the annual and immediate needs of the Panda Centers
        managed by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant
        Panda. The personal relationships she has developed with Chinese
        officials, veterinarians and their staff members have allowed Pandas
        International to maximize its role in preserving this beloved species.
